title: "Samuel Stanhope Smith"

Samuel Stanhope Smith was a Princeton alumni and the seventh President of the University,
serving from 1795-1812.

Smith was a proponent of the “unity of mankind." He believed that environment, not biology determined race.
Specifically, Smith promoted the idea that all men created equal; however, he still believed that white people were still superior,
and Black people’s defective environment made them different. Furthermore, he thought that when integration occurs with
white people and Black people, you are able to “fix” Black people. While Smith's beliefs are considered to be progressive
for his time, his take on "geographic racism" is still racism nonetheless.

Smith's beliefs in the "unity of mankind" did not stop him from enslaving individuals. He also
influenced Princeton's alumni to estaablish the American Colonization Society.

Stanhope Hall is currently home to the University's African American Studies department. To better represent and honor
the important work being done in this very building, we chose five POC individuals who have made an impact at Princeton. To find
