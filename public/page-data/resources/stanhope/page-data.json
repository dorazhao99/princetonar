Furthermore, he thought that when integration occurs with\nwhite people and Black people, you are able to “fix” Black people. While Smith's beliefs are considered to be progressive\nfor his time, his take on \"geographic racism\" is still racism nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Smith's beliefs in the \"unity of mankind\" did not stop him from enslaving individuals. He also\ninfluenced Princeton's alumni to estaablish the American Colonization Society.</p>\n<p>Stanhope Hall is currently home to the University's African American Studies department. To better represent and honor\nthe important work being done in this very building, we chose five POC individuals who have made an impact at Princeton.
